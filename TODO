This list is stuff we are looking for someone to work on in Xerlin. These
are listed somewhat in order of priority.

1. Documentation
     a. End-user documentation
     b. Developer docs
         i. Plugin development guide - Tim McCune
        ii. project architecture - Kelly Campbell
     c. javadocs in source code

2. DTD/Schema catalog support
	integrate with DTDCache

3. Make PluginClassLoader faster/better, especially for handling embedded jars

4. Handling different attribute types like ID, IDREF, NMTOKEN, etc. properly.
    ID fields should be kept in a map somewhere so that no duplicate
    id's are entered by the user. IDREFs must refer to a valid ID in the
    document.

5. User preferences dialog

6. Find function based on XPath expressions

7. Localize the menus and other resources in org.merlotxml.merlot.resource 
    for languages other than English
